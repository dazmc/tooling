# pandoc

Enables us to generate pdf/html and other file types form markdown files

- Install - see the pandoc-install.txt

## PDF

1. PDF - make sure it is rename to Makefile in the process
   cp Makefile.pdf /to/target/directory/with/markdowns/Makefile
2. change to the directory containing the markdowns
   cd /to/target/directory/with/markdowns
3. run make - this will create a directory called pdf which contains pdf versions of your markdown
   make

NOTE: if you see this error edit the mark down find the list which is nested and correct
Error producing PDF.
! LaTeX Error: Too deeply nested.

i.e.

- this
  - doesn't
    - work
- this
  - works
  - fine

## POWERPOINT

1. Powerpoint - make sure it is rename to Makefile in the process
   cp Makefile.powerpoint /to/target/directory/with/markdowns/Makefile
2. change to the directory containing the markdowns
   cd /to/target/directory/with/markdowns
3. run make - this will create a directory called powerpoint which contains pdf versions of your markdown
   make

NOTE: when you open in powerpoint some text boxes can be too big (flows off the slide) select the box and move
it will then auto resize to fit the slide
NOTE: if there is still too much text on a slide (text is cramped and small) in powerpoint then in your markdown
seperate the text with '---', pandoc will treat this as a new slide when converting to powerpoint

## HTML5 Slides

1. revealjs - make sure it is rename to Makefile in the process and copy slides.css
   cp Makefile.revealjs /to/target/directory/with/markdowns/Makefile
   cp slides.css /to/target/directory/with/markdowns/
2. change to the directory containing the markdowns
   cd /to/target/directory/with/markdowns
3. run make - this will create a directory called revealjs which contains html5 slides (chrome) versions of your markdown
   make

NOTE: The Makefile can generate different formats, colours - uncomment the one you want to try
the one presently used (revealjs) looks best for me. There are variations for revealjs and also slidy
NOTE: in chrome or edge go full screen (F11 for me) when presenting the slides
NOTE: some text doesn't fit on the screen - it overflows - in your markdown seperate the text with '---',
pandoc will treat this as a new slide when converting to revealjs
